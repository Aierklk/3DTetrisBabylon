 RJ and Anna's Intern Project 2019
## Goal: 
Develop 3D experiences through a game using practical examples of various commonly used data structures and software design principles.
This game uses Babylon.js, a 3D engine.

The game we will be making is a 3D Tetris. Users will have the ability to move the blocks on the x, y, and z-axis, allowing for a three dimensional experience.
