 RJ and Anna's Intern Project 2019
## Goal: 
Develop 3D experiences through a game using practical examples of various commonly used data structures and software design principles. We will be using Babylon.js.

The game we will be making is a modified Tetris. All the elements will be in 3D. Users will have the ability to move the blocks on the x-, y-, and z-axis, allowing for a three dimensional experience.
